# taptagreact
This is the taptag website for my internship that I made through React. First, I started off with html that I have uploaded on github. Then I used that html to move on to React.js. As it was my first time to move the information from html to React, I had some issues with it. I took around a week to work on this website. I fixed some issues on the website that I had with html. I fixed the download button and the popup menu; however, I had issues with the arrows on the image slider, which for some reason does not work with any images or icons. This is without nodejs.
